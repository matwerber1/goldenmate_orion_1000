- use the checklists in docs/implementation_status.md to track implementation status of the phases and steps of each phase outlined in docs/implementation_plan.md as work is completed on this project.

- If you perform work that is not part of the implementation plan phases or steps, record this as an additional list item under a separate section titled "Unplanned work" in implementation_status.md. Each unplanned item should be summarized as a single clear and concise sentence.

- When you begin work on a phase or step from the implementation plan, update it's status in implementation_status.md to IN_PROGRESS.

- If you complete a phase or step from the implementation plan, update it's status in implementation_status.md to PENDING_APPROVAL.

- If I tell you to mark a step or phase as complete, set its status to APPROVED in implementation_status.md.

- If all steps of a phase are in COMPLETED status, mark the phase as COMPLETE.

- When a python file is created or modified as part of an implementation phase, create or update an alphabetical list of affected files in that specific phase's section of the implementation status file.
