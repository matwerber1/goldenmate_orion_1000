- if pyproject.toml does not already exist in the project root, use uv to create one for this project.
- if .venv does not already exist in the project root, use uv to create a virtual env at .venv for this project.
- if a python version file does not already exist, use uv to create one and pin the project python version to 3.13.
- use uv to manage project python dependencies
- if not already activated, activate the project's virtual env by running `source .venv/bin/activate`
- add an empty **init**.py to any newly-created sub-directories within the tests/ directory.
- add type annotations to all function and method return types. If a function or method does not return a value, use "-> None".
- add type annotations to all parameters in function and method call signatures
- after finishing changes to a file, run "ruff format" on that file.

- import the logging package and create a logger with "logger = logging.getLogger(**name**)" at the top of each module. Within each module, leverage the built-in logger methods info, debug, warn, and exception in a best-practices manner.
